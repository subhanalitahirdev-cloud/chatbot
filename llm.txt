Our Projects
1- Hairsmailer — AI-Driven CRM & Email Marketing Intelligence
Overview:
We built Hairsmailer as a next-generation AI-powered CRM and marketing automation suite — designed to make intelligent, human-like campaign management a reality. It combines LLM-based automation, voice-driven navigation, and end-to-end marketing orchestration, allowing users to manage inbound and outbound campaigns, customer relationships, and lead pipelines — all through natural conversation.
Hairsmailer don't just send emails. It thinks, plans, and executes personalized campaigns by understanding context, tone, and audience behavior — positioning it as one of the most advanced AI CRM frameworks we’ve engineered.
Problem:
Traditional CRM and email marketing systems have remained largely mechanical — they depend on predefined workflows, manual configuration, and repetitive campaign setups.
This creates inefficiency, slows marketing velocity, and limits personalization — especially for teams lacking dedicated data or copywriting resources.
We identified the gap: there was no intelligent CRM capable of understanding a business’s intent, generating full campaigns autonomously, and integrating AI-first voice navigation for non-technical marketers.
Solution:
We designed Hairsmailer to function as a conversational marketing brain. Users can talk to the platform — by text or voice — and say things like:
“Create a 5-day re-engagement campaign for inactive leads who opened at least one email in the last 30 days.”
Within seconds, Hairsmailer uses LangChain, LangGraph, and custom LLM pipelines deployed on AWS Bedrock to:
1- Understand intent.


2- Fetch customer data.


3- Generate full email sequences, subject lines, and content variations.


4- Schedule, track, and A/B test performance.


5- Automate CRM actions — tagging, scoring, and lead assignment.


The AI layer dynamically interacts with the CRM core, updating pipelines, assigning follow-ups, and suggesting next actions — effectively merging marketing intelligence with operational automation.

Technical Architecture & Stack in Hairsmailer:
Frontend:
Framework: Next.js (latest) + TypeScript


UI Layer: TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI, Framer Motion for rich, dynamic animations


Voice & Command Interface: Web Speech API + Custom NLP Parsing


Backend:
Server Environment: Node.js (TypeScript runtime)


Core APIs: REST + GraphQL hybrid for modular extensibility


LLM Engine: LangChain + LangGraph orchestrating Bedrock models (Anthropic Claude, GPT-family fallbacks)


Email Engine: Mailtrap integration (for dev/test), SMTP + Mailgun/Nodemailer for production delivery


AI Workflow: Custom context builders for intent recognition, campaign generation, and CRM event triggers


Database & Cloud Infrastructure:
Primary Database: PostgreSQL (managed on Supabase)


Cache & Session: Redis for state tracking of conversational sessions


Cloud Deployment: AWS (EC2 + Bedrock + Lambda for AI endpoints)


Monitoring & CI/CD: GitHub Actions → AWS Amplify for frontend deploy, Terraform for IaC provisioning


Security & Data Layer:
JWT-based session authentication, role-based access control


Encrypted storage of customer metadata and campaign logs


GDPR-compliant data lifecycle management


AI & Automation Highlights
Voice-driven CRM navigation: The system interprets natural voice prompts to execute UI-level actions (e.g., “Open Campaign Analytics”).


Autonomous content generation: LLMs write high-conversion copy informed by CRM data.


Predictive scheduling: AI recommends send times based on engagement history.


Dynamic lead scoring: Machine-learning signals rank leads by conversion potential.


Outcome & Impact
Hairsmailer demonstrates how AI can redefine CRM dynamics by bridging natural language understanding, marketing logic, and real-time automation.
It delivers:
10× faster campaign deployment vs. manual workflows.


Up to 35% higher open-rate improvement during A/B testing.


A seamless voice-operated CRM experience built for the next decade of intelligent business systems.


We continue evolving Hairsmailer toward full-stack conversational marketing — where every touchpoint, from lead generation to analytics, is managed by AI orchestration.

2- The Crimson Market — Integrated AI Ecosystem
The Crimson Market represents one of our most comprehensive multi-product builds — a suite of connected applications combining AI-driven engagement, cross-platform scalability, and data-rich marketing automation.
We did three major projects for the Crimson Market: a high-performance web rendering platform, a React Native app with AI feedback intelligence, and a custom-built email marketing & CRM tool.
1️⃣ Crimson Market Web Platform — Rendering, Databases & Ecosystem Architecture
Overview
We built the core web infrastructure for the Crimson Market — a high-speed rendering engine powering the gaming marketplace, NFT-like token utilities, and user dashboards.
Our goal was to design a scalable, real-time architecture capable of managing dynamic content (cards, game data, user profiles, token operations) while maintaining lightning-fast load performance.
Problem
Crimson Market required a highly responsive rendering pipeline capable of handling real-time data updates, game state visuals, and tokenized asset interactions — all without traditional page reload bottlenecks.
Solution
We developed a custom rendering engine with Next.js + React 18 (concurrent features) and server-side streaming, integrated with MongoDB and Mongoose ORM for scalable, document-based data handling.
We used Edge Functions for distributed response latency reduction and Redis caching for dynamic content hydration.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React Query


Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript


Database: MongoDB with Mongoose


Cache Layer: Redis


Infrastructure: AWS Lambda + CloudFront CDN


Rendering: SSR + ISR hybrid architecture


Monitoring: Sentry + Grafana


Outcome
We achieved 60% faster initial loads, 95% uptime SLA, and a scalable foundation that now supports both the mobile and marketing subsystems.
The web engine became the “central nervous system” of the Crimson Market ecosystem.
2️⃣ Crimson Market React Native App — AI Feedback & Routine Intelligence
Overview
vWe built a cross-platform React Native app (iOS + Android) to extend Crimson Market’s engagement layer beyond the web — focusing on AI-based feedback and personalized human optimization.
This mobile app is powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and body-pose analysis models, offering users intelligent health, fitness, and performance feedback.
Problem
Human performance data was trapped in static forms — users needed an AI-driven way to receive real-time feedback, interpret posture data, and build personalized improvement routines.
Solution
We integrated a TensorFlow Lite model for on-device pose estimation, paired with a custom NLP engine that interpreted context and generated actionable feedback.
The app analyzed user movements, gave guidance (“Straighten your shoulders”), and suggested adaptive routines — powered by AI text generation tuned for motivation and safety.
Tech Stack
Framework: React Native (TypeScript)


AI/ML: TensorFlow Lite (pose detection), NLP (OpenAI fine-tuned model)


Backend: Node.js, Express, Supabase for auth and data sync


Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)


State Management: Redux Toolkit


Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)


CI/CD: Fastlane + App Center


Outcome
We created an AI-powered mobile assistant that delivers real-time body feedback, routine planning, and personalized performance insights.
It bridged the gap between human motion data and intelligent action, paving the way for future wearable integrations.

3️⃣ Crimson Market Email Marketing & CRM Tool — AI-Powered Engagement Suite
Overview
To unify Crimson Market’s customer engagement, we built a custom email marketing and CRM tool from scratch, focused on automated outreach and AI-enhanced communication.
Problem
Crimson Market needed a lightweight CRM system to manage campaigns, track users, and automate communication — but existing SaaS tools were overkill, expensive, and didn’t align with their ecosystem’s data model.
Solution
We engineered a NodeMailer-based email engine with SMTP and automation layers, connected to a MongoDB-based CRM system.
The AI layer generated personalized content and automated follow-ups based on behavioral triggers — open rates, click events, and purchase history.
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript


Mailer Engine: NodeMailer + SMTP integration


AI Content Layer: OpenAI API + fine-tuned GPT for email generation


Database: MongoDB + Mongoose


Email Testing: Mailtrap sandbox


Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS for CRM dashboard


Hosting: Vercel + AWS EC2 for backend


Outcome
We delivered a fully functional AI email suite that increased outbound engagement efficiency by over 40%, enabling Crimson Market to manage its users and campaigns internally without relying on external CRMs.
Overall Impact
Across these three projects, we transformed Crimson Market into a multi-dimensional AI ecosystem — spanning:
Web rendering & data systems


Mobile intelligence via AI feedback


Marketing & CRM automation


Together, these systems make Crimson Market not just a platform — but a smart, adaptive network for digital engagement, growth, and human performance.
