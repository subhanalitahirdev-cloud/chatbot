Our Projects
1- Hairsmailer — AI-Driven CRM & Email Marketing Intelligence
Overview:
We built Hairsmailer as a next-generation AI-powered CRM and marketing automation suite — designed to make intelligent, human-like campaign management a reality. It combines LLM-based automation, voice-driven navigation, and end-to-end marketing orchestration, allowing users to manage inbound and outbound campaigns, customer relationships, and lead pipelines — all through natural conversation.
Hairsmailer don't just send emails. It thinks, plans, and executes personalized campaigns by understanding context, tone, and audience behavior — positioning it as one of the most advanced AI CRM frameworks we’ve engineered.
Problem:
Traditional CRM and email marketing systems have remained largely mechanical — they depend on predefined workflows, manual configuration, and repetitive campaign setups.
This creates inefficiency, slows marketing velocity, and limits personalization — especially for teams lacking dedicated data or copywriting resources.
We identified the gap: there was no intelligent CRM capable of understanding a business’s intent, generating full campaigns autonomously, and integrating AI-first voice navigation for non-technical marketers.
Solution:
We designed Hairsmailer to function as a conversational marketing brain. Users can talk to the platform — by text or voice — and say things like:
“Create a 5-day re-engagement campaign for inactive leads who opened at least one email in the last 30 days.”
Within seconds, Hairsmailer uses LangChain, LangGraph, and custom LLM pipelines deployed on AWS Bedrock to:
1- Understand intent.


2- Fetch customer data.


3- Generate full email sequences, subject lines, and content variations.


4- Schedule, track, and A/B test performance.


5- Automate CRM actions — tagging, scoring, and lead assignment.


The AI layer dynamically interacts with the CRM core, updating pipelines, assigning follow-ups, and suggesting next actions — effectively merging marketing intelligence with operational automation.

Technical Architecture & Stack in Hairsmailer:

2- The Crimson Market — Integrated AI Ecosystem
The Crimson Market represents one of our most comprehensive multi-product builds — a suite of connected applications combining AI-driven engagement, cross-platform scalability, and data-rich marketing automation.
We did three major projects for the Crimson Market: a high-performance web rendering platform, a React Native app with AI feedback intelligence, and a custom-built email marketing & CRM tool.
1️⃣ Crimson Market Web Platform — Rendering, Databases & Ecosystem Architecture
Overview
We built the core web infrastructure for the Crimson Market — a high-speed rendering engine powering the gaming marketplace, NFT-like token utilities, and user dashboards.
Our goal was to design a scalable, real-time architecture capable of managing dynamic content (cards, game data, user profiles, token operations) while maintaining lightning-fast load performance.
Problem
Crimson Market required a highly responsive rendering pipeline capable of handling real-time data updates, game state visuals, and tokenized asset interactions — all without traditional page reload bottlenecks.
Solution
We developed a custom rendering engine with Next.js + React 18 (concurrent features) and server-side streaming, integrated with MongoDB and Mongoose ORM for scalable, document-based data handling.
We used Edge Functions for distributed response latency reduction and Redis caching for dynamic content hydration.
Tech Stack

Outcome
We achieved 60% faster initial loads, 95% uptime SLA, and a scalable foundation that now supports both the mobile and marketing subsystems.
The web engine became the “central nervous system” of the Crimson Market ecosystem.
2️⃣ Crimson Market React Native App — AI Feedback & Routine Intelligence
Overview
vWe built a cross-platform React Native app (iOS + Android) to extend Crimson Market’s engagement layer beyond the web — focusing on AI-based feedback and personalized human optimization.
This mobile app is powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and body-pose analysis models, offering users intelligent health, fitness, and performance feedback.
Problem
Human performance data was trapped in static forms — users needed an AI-driven way to receive real-time feedback, interpret posture data, and build personalized improvement routines.
Solution
We integrated a TensorFlow Lite model for on-device pose estimation, paired with a custom NLP engine that interpreted context and generated actionable feedback.
The app analyzed user movements, gave guidance (“Straighten your shoulders”), and suggested adaptive routines — powered by AI text generation tuned for motivation and safety.
Tech Stack
Framework: React Native (TypeScript)


AI/ML: TensorFlow Lite (pose detection), NLP (OpenAI fine-tuned model)


Backend: Node.js, Express, Supabase for auth and data sync


Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

CI/CD: Fastlane + App Center


Outcome
We created an AI-powered mobile assistant that delivers real-time body feedback, routine planning, and personalized performance insights.
It bridged the gap between human motion data and intelligent action, paving the way for future wearable integrations.

3️⃣ Crimson Market Email Marketing & CRM Tool — AI-Powered Engagement Suite
Overview
To unify Crimson Market’s customer engagement, we built a custom email marketing and CRM tool from scratch, focused on automated outreach and AI-enhanced communication.
Problem
Crimson Market needed a lightweight CRM system to manage campaigns, track users, and automate communication — but existing SaaS tools were overkill, expensive, and didn’t align with their ecosystem’s data model.
Solution
We engineered a NodeMailer-based email engine with SMTP and automation layers, connected to a MongoDB-based CRM system.
The AI layer generated personalized content and automated follow-ups based on behavioral triggers — open rates, click events, and purchase history.
